# User Experience (UX)

## Application Goals

- To provide a time management system that optimises the productivity of employees by automating idle routines such as recording clocking times, time-off entitlements and group absences.
- To deliver information as intuitively as possible by providing descriptive messages and a clear content structure.

## Target Audience

- small business owners, supervisors and their employees

## User Stories

- As a superuser (business owner / supervisor),
    - I want the login credentials to be secure so that an unauthorised person cannot access the admin account.

    - I want to be able to review a list of all requests easily so that I don't miss anything.
    - I want to be able to see the team's availability so that I can easily determine whether I can approve or reject new absence requests.

    - I want the system to programmatically generate payslips so that I can avoid idle and error-prone routines.
    - I want to be able to add a new employee to the system so that they can start using the system immediately.
